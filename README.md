## Introduction

To complete the Data Analytics course at [Northeastern University London](https://www.nulondon.ac.uk/), I had to produce the final project to fulfill the following criteria:

- Provide the project rationale.
- Utilize a minimum of 3 technologies, e.g., [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) & [Standard SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/introduction)
- Collect feedback, i.e., make pull requests on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en), adding @missKatiaPunter  & @T-J-Summer  as reviewers 
- Use data visualization, i.e., bar charts ðŸ“Š, scatter plots & line charts etc. 
- Document the project in [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en), [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/docs), [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) & [Slides.com](https://slides.com/)
- Apply Agile methodologies, i.e., [Kanban Boards](https://github.com/topics/kanban)
- Use some statistical and machine learning analysis
- Reach a conclusion 

## Rationale

### Why did I choose this topic for my project?

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) virus. 

If infected with the virus, you may experience mild to moderate respiratory illness if infected with the virus and recover without medical assistance. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Coronavirus affects all ages and individuals differently depending on factors such as age, lifestyle, health, etc.

The main reason for choosing this dataset is because **COVID-19** was and still is a huge part of all our lives, due to it being a global disease, and I wanted a dataset that I would feel passionate about digging into and the **"covid19_open_data".** I have selected on [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/) allows me to analyse and compare factors that increased the chances of more individuals dying or catching the disease, such as, the more schools closed, did fewer people die due to the disease.

Secondly, there was an extraordinary range of government responses that happened worldwide when COVID-19 started spreading, which led to their being a vast amount of data to explore and compare. They included:

- Closures of schools, train stations, and aeroports,
- Emergency investments in healthcare,
- Travel restrictions,
- Contact tracing,
- Emergency welfare provisions,
- Investments in vaccinations,
- Many other interventions.

Nowadays, it is paramount to investigate those measures' comparative effectiveness in case another pandemic happens. Albeit a beginner data analyst, I wanted to do one of such analytic explorations.


## Obtaining Data

### Where did I get my data?

I got my data from a [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/) public dataset.
I started with exploring my data using [standard SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/introduction).
My first query was the one below ðŸ‘‡.
```
SELECT
  MAX(date) as end_date,
  MIN(date) as start_date
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data_eu.covid19_open_data`;
```
When I run the query above, I got the following result: 

![Screenshot from Bigquery](data_period_screenshot.png)

After running my first query, I decided to run a query that would find out how many countries where recorded in my dataset ðŸ‘‡.

```
SELECT
  DISTINCT country_name,
  country_code
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data_eu.covid19_open_data`
ORDER BY
  country_code;
```
When I run the query above, it produced the following result:

### Why did I choose my data?

As stated above, the main reason for choosing this dataset is because **COVID-19** was and still is a huge part of all our lives due to it being a global disease, and I wanted a dataset that I would feel passionate about digging into and the **"covid19_open_data"** seemed precisely that. I have selected BigQuery as it is a part of [the Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/docs) and subsequently very fast. Moreover, it allows me to use [Standard SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/introduction) to analyse and filter the data before uploading it to a Jupyter notebook. In this project, I wanted to compare the effects of different government response actions, e.g., school closures, transport closures, vaccinations, etc. 

> My ultimate goal was to identify the government response most effectively fighting the pandemic.

## Schema
| Name | Type | Description | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **date** | `Date` |(YYYY-MM-DD)| 2020-05-07 |
| **new_confirmed** | `Integer` | Count of new cases confirmed after positive test on this date | 64.0 |
| **new_deceased** | `Integer` | Count of new deaths from a positive COVID-19 case on this date | 9.0 |
| **country_name** | `String` | Name of each country where the data has been recorded for| United Kingdom |
| **school_closing** | `Integer` | Record to show how each country responded to covid-19 on this date eg 0 - means weak response, 3 - means very strong | 1 |
| **workplace_closing** | `Integer` | Record to show how each country responded to covid-19 on this date eg 0 - means weak response, 3 - means very strong | 2 |
| **public_transport_closing** | `Integer` | Record to show how each country responded to covid-19 on this date eg 0 - means weak response, 3 - means very strong | 3 |

**new_confirmed** - Values can be negative, typically indicating a correction or an adjustment in the way they were measured. For example, a case might have been incorrectly flagged as recovered one date so it will be subtracted from the following date.

## Tech Stack

For my project, I have chosen the following stacks:

- [Standard SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/introduction)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction)

## Processes

The basic Kanban board from GitHub Projects was used for Project Management ðŸ‘‡

### Why did I use a Kanban board?

A Kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency. I chose to use a Kanban board because it allowed me to group my project tasks into sections such as "To Do," "In Progress," "In Review" and "Done." This was very beneficial because I knew what needed to be done first and what I was waiting on a response for and could leave for a moment It also allowed me to see how long I was spending on a task helping me to manage my time better. I only had 3 weeks to complete my final project and time management was vital.
